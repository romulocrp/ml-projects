# Machine Learning Projects

This is a repository to post notebooks on solving problems with Machine Learning, each notebook will carry the problem or project in question and is separated between Begginer and Advanced.

## Begginers Folder

Focused on solving problems, not really on how useful the solution is, steps 2, 3, 4, and part of 5 of the CRISP-DM.

## Advanced Folder

Focused on more elaborate answers and usefulness of solutions, that could be implemented somewhere, focus on the total CRISP-DM methodology.
